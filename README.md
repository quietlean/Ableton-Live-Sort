Yo welcome to _Ableton Live Sort_. 

I made this because I thought I'd be a handy tool. There might be extensions in the future for further functionality.

You can drop the program anywhere you want on your machine.

I think the programm is pretty much self-explanatory. 

You open it and enter the path to a folder. For example `/Users/AngelaMerkel/Music/Ableton_Files`. Ideally there are **.als** files in there. If not it will let you know. 

You have to enter the Live Version you are using. For example **Ableton Live 11 Suite**. If you enter a wrong program-name the files can not be opend.

The existing Live Files will be displayed and sorted acording to the time of the last edit. The 175 most recently edited files will be displayed.

If you find a bug or want to participate on the repository let me know ðŸ’‹
