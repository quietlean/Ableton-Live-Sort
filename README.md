Yo welcome to _Ableton Live Sort_. 

I made this because I thought I'd be a handy tool. There might be extensions in the future for further functionality.

I think the programm is pretty much self-explanatory. 

You open it and enter the path to a folder. For example `/Users/AngelaMerkel/Music/Ableton_Files`. Ideally there are **.als** files in there. If not it will let you know. 

You have to enter the Live Version you are using. For example **Ableton Live Suite 11**.

If you find a bug or want to participate to the repository let me know ðŸ’‹
