Yo welcome to Ableton Live Sort. 

I made this cause I thought I'd be handy tool. There might be extensions in the future for further functionality.

I think the programm is pretty much self-explanatory. You open it and select a folder. 
Ideally there .als files in there. If not it will let you know. 

You have to enter the Live Version you are using, like "Ableton Live Suite 11".

If you find a bug or want to participate on the repository let me know ðŸ’‹
